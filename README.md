### Hi there 👋 I'm Erik Yuzwa / Wazoo

I'm a full stack engineer at [Wazoo Enterprises Inc](https://wazooinc.com/) mostly working in JavaScript and Ruby on Rails. 

I also have a [blog](https://erikyuzwa.com/) 📝 where I write about game development or other things, and a small [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCb4pd5r8O3R1bRqP-HY3q0g).
