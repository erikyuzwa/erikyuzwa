### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Erik Yuzwa / Wazoo

I'm a full stack engineer at [Wazoo Enterprises Inc](https://wazooinc.com/) mostly working in JavaScript and Ruby on Rails. 

I also have a small game development channel on [@ErikYuzwa](https://www.youtube.com/@ErikYuzwa) and another channel
that is more web development teaching focused at [@WazooWebBytes](https://www.youtube.com/@WazooWebBytes).
