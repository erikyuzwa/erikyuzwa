### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Erik Yuzwa / Wazoo

I'm a full stack engineer mostly working in frontend technologies like JavaScript and backend technologies like Ruby on Rails, Java Spring Boot
and sprinkles of PHP.

I have a game development channel on [@ErikYuzwa](https://www.youtube.com/@ErikYuzwa) where I play some games, go through game
development tutorials (using primarily C or C++) and highlight other projects around the web that look interesting.

I also have a channel focused on web development at [@WazooWebBytes](https://www.youtube.com/@WazooWebBytes).
