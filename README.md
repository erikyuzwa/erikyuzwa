### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Erik Yuzwa / Wazoo

I'm a full stack engineer mostly working in frontend technologies like JavaScript and backend technologies like Ruby on Rails, Java Sprint Boot
and sprinkles of PHP.

I also have a small game development channel on [@ErikYuzwa](https://www.youtube.com/@ErikYuzwa) and another channel
that is more web development teaching focused at [@WazooWebBytes](https://www.youtube.com/@WazooWebBytes).
